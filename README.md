# Dream Of DAW:

A DAW written in Rust and Python3 for retro-emulaiton handhelds running linux.

it allows for:
- running/loading VST3 plugings
- game controller controls
- 4 instrument plugins (on for each channel)
- 3 effects per channel
- 3 effects on the main outputs

## TODO

- design an sqlite schema for storing and recalling plugin information.
- make a UI toolkit for pygame for my specific use case.
